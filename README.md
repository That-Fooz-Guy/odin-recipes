#odin-recipes
    This is a simple recipe website put together as a Demonstration of basic HTML and CSS.

    This project is designed to be a showcase of HTML and CSS code that I've learned through The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/), Which will include:

    -Basic HTML boilerplate
    -Relative and Absolute links
    -Ordered and Unordered Lists
    -Images and their metadata
    -<div> tags
    -classes, IDs, and how they can be styled

    As a side, I also included <detals>, and <summary> tags to help
    stylize the layout further than required of the assignment

    Recepies and Images are taken from Allrecipes 
    (https://www.allrecipes.com/)
