#odin-recipes
    This is a simple recipe website put together as a Demonstration of basic HTML and CSS.

    This project is designed to be a showcase of what I've learned through The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/) in regards to HTML (and later CSS) Which will include:
    -Basic HTML boilerplate
    -Relative and Absolute links
    -Ordered and Unordered Lists
    -Images and their metadata
    


    Recepies and Images are taken from Allrecipes 
    (https://www.allrecipes.com/)
